    "# Exercise 4 - Spell Correction\n",
    "(8 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you should finish the implementation of the `TrigramBasedSpellCorrector` class by implementing a) the creation of a tri-gram matrix from a given text and b) a simple spell correction that is based on the trigrams in the matrix and the Levenshtein distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this exercise, code from the other three exercises might be reusable. However, please think about which parts you want to reuse. Not all of them might be necssary or helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the test, we are using texts from [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) for getting a larger amount of tri-grams. The file `shakespeare.txt` can be downloaded from [http://norvig.com/ngrams/shakespeare.txt](http://norvig.com/ngrams/shakespeare.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matrix Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of the matrix is based on a given text. This text should be preprocessed with the same preprocessing rules as in Exercise 1 of this exercise series. After that, the tri-grams need to be extracted and stored in a way that they can be reused for getting word candidates for the spell correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* While the bi-gram matrix might work as a dense matrix implementation, the tri-gram matrix should use an implementation which is optimized for a sparse matrix. Otherwise, your solution might get memory issues.\n",
    "* Make sure that the creation of your matrix does not take too much time. The hidden tests might have to initialize your matrix several times and if this takes more than 1 minute, it might be possible that the complete evaluation of your solution creates a time out (would result in 0 points). (hint: reading the content of the `shakespeare.txt` file and generating the matrix typically takes less than 2 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spell Correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The spell correction should be implemented in the `getCorrection(String word1, String word2, String word3)`. It gets a tri-gram $(w_1,w_2,w_3)$ as input where the third word $w_3$ might be misspelled. Its aim is to provide a correct word which fits to the first two words of the trigram. Its internal process should be based on the following two steps:\n",
    "1. Get a list of candidate words $w_c$ from the tri-gram matrix which are known to occur as $(w_1,w_2,w_c)$.\n",
    "2. From this list, choose the word that has the smallest Levenshtein distance to $w_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen word should be returned as the suggested correction for the third word.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* The given words of the tri-gram may have to be preprocessed to fit to the preprocessed words from the text. However, you can assume that every given word will be a single word even after applying the preprocessing, i.e., non of the words swill contain characters that are not alphanumerical.\n",
    "* If the list of candidates is empty (because $w_1$, $w_2$ or their combination are simply not available in your tri-gram matrix), your solution should return `null`.\n",
    "* If more than 1 candidate have the lowest Levenshtein distance, all solutions will be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following text could be used as basis for the tri-gram matrix.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "London is the capital and largest city of England. Million people live in London. \n",
    "The River Thames is in London. London is the largest city in Western Europe.\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the following tri-grams, your implementation of the `getCorrection` method should return the following results:\n",
